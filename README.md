# Methylation Prediction

The goal of this project is find potential regulator of DNA methylation in cancer patients. As a first step, we examine the LAML data set from [Figueroa et al. 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610809004206) and aims to
- identify subgroups of methylation sites with similar expression pattern in LAML patients from Figueroa dataset 
- find the gene that are strongly associate with the methylation profile of each subgroup of methylation sites

TCGA LAML dataset is used for validation of the findings.
